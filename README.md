# Horiseon Search Engine Optimization

## Description

This week we refactored the Horiseon Website's codebase to follow accessibility standards in order to optimize the site. We restructed the the codebase so that you can find semantic HTML elements that are structured in a way that is logical and independent of styling and positioning. Image elements were given accessible alt attributes to make it user friendly.
